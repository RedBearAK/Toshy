# Current status: Early Beta

- May have issues installing on distros not on the "tested" list below.  

- May seem to run but not do any remapping, needing `toshy-config-start-verbose` in the terminal to troubleshoot.  

- May cause the keyboard in some odd circumstances after install to have no output (default emergency bail out key is F16). If you don't have F16 on your keyboard, you may need to stop the Toshy services from the tray icon menu, or by opening the "Preferences" app from a menu with the mouse and stop the services.  

# Toshy README

## Make your Linux keyboard act like a 'Tosh! (or, What the Heck is This?!?)

Toshy is a config file for the `keyszer` Python-based keymapper for Linux (which was forked from `xkeysnail`). The Toshy config is not strictly a fork of Kinto, but was based in the beginning entirely on the config file for Kinto.sh by Ben Reaves (https://github.com/rbreaves/kinto or https://kinto.sh). Without Kinto, Toshy would not exist.  Using Toshy will feel basically the same as using Kinto, just with some new features and some problems solved.  

The purpose of Toshy is to match, as closely as possible, the behavior of keyboard shortcuts in macOS when working on similar applications in Linux. General system-wide shortcuts such as Cmd+Q/W/A/Z/X/C/V and so on are relatively easy to mimic by just moving the modifier key locations, with `modmaps`. A lot of shortcuts in Linux just use `Ctrl` in the place of where macOS would use `Cmd`. But many other shortcut combos from macOS applications have to be remapped onto entirely different shortcut combos in the Linux equivalent application. This is done using application-specific `keymaps`, that only become active when you are using the specified application or window.  

All of this basic functionality is inherited from Kinto. Toshy just tries to be a bit fancier in implementing it.  

## Toshifying an Application

If an app that you use frequently in Linux has some shortcut behavior that still doesn't match what you'd expect from the same application (or a similar application) in macOS, after Toshy's general remapping of the modifier keys, you can add a keymap that matches the app's "class" and/or "name/title" window attributes, to make that application behave as expected. By adding it to the default config file, every user will benefit!  

To do this, on X11 you need the tool `xprop` which lets you retrieve the window attributes by clicking on the window with the mouse. Use this command to get only the relevant attributes:  

```sh
xprop WM_CLASS _NET_WM_NAME
```

The mouse cursor will change to a cross shape. Click on the window in question and the attributes will appear in the terminal.  

## Windows Support

Toshy has no Windows version, unlike the Kinto.sh project. I was trying to solve a number of issues and add features to the Linux version of Kinto, so that's all I'm focused on for Toshy. The Windows version of Kinto works great. Go check it out if you need Mac-like keyboard shortcuts on Windows. I also contribute to Kinto on the Windows side.  

## Keyboard Types

Four different keyboard types are supported by Toshy (Windows/PC, Mac/Apple, IBM and Chromebook), just as in Kinto. But Toshy does its best to automatically treat each keyboard device as the correct type in real-time, as you use it, rather than requiring you to change the keyboard type from a menu. This means that you _should_ be able to use an Apple keyboard connected to a PC laptop, or an IBM keyboard connected to a MacBook, and shortcut combos on both the external and internal keyboards should work as expected, with the modifier keys appearing to be in the correct place to "Act like a 'Tosh".  

## Option-key Special Characters

Toshy includes a complete implementation of the macOS Option-key special characters, including all the "dead key" accent keys, from two keyboard layouts. The standard US keyboard layout, and the "ABC Extended" layout (which is still a US keyboard layout otherwise). This adds up to somewhere over 600 special characters being available, between the two layouts. It works just the same way it does on macOS, when you hold the Option or Shift+Option keys. For example, Option+E, then Shift+E, gets you an "E" with Acute accent: Ã‰.  

The special characters may not work as expected unless you add a bit of "throttle" delay to the macro output. This is a new `keyszer` API function that inserts timing delays in the output of combos that involve modifier keys. There is a general problem with Linux keymappers using `libinput` in a lot of situations, especially in virtual machines, with the modifier key presses being misinterpreted as occuring at a slightly different time, leading to problems with macro output. A slight delay will usually clear this right up, but a virtual machine environment may need a few dozen milliseconds to achieve macro stability. In fact it's not just macros, but many shortcuts in general may seem very flaky or unusuble in a VM, and this will impact the Option-key special characters, since it uses Unicode macro sequences.  

A dedicated Unicode processing function was added to `keyszer` that made it possible to bring the Option-key special characters to Linux, where previously I could only add it to the Windows version of Kinto using AutoHotkey.  

If you're curious about what characters are available and how to access them, the fully documented lists for each layout are available here:  

https://github.com/RedBearAK/optspecialchars

It's important to understand that your actual keyboard layout will have no effect on the layout used by the Option-key special character scheme. The keymapper generally has no idea what your keyboard layout is, and has a tendency to treat your keyboard as if it is always a US layout. This is a problem that needs a solution. I haven't found even so much as a way to reliably detect the active keyboard layout. So currently Toshy works best with a US layout.  

The other problem is that the Unicode entry shortcut only seems to work if you have `ibus` or `fcitx` (unconfirmed) set up as your input manager. If not, the special characters (or any other Unicode character sequence) will only work correctly in GTK apps, which seem to have the built-in ability to understand the Shift+Ctrl+U shortcut that invokes Unicode character entry.  

There's no simple way around this, since the keymapper is only designed to send key codes from a virtual keyboard. Unlike AutoHotkey in Windows, which can just "send" a character pasted in an AHK script to an application (although there are potential problems with that if the AHK file encoding is wrong). 

## General improvements over Kinto's config

 1. Multi-user support: I believe some changes I've made will facilitate proper multi-user support on the same system. Even in the case of the user invoking a "Switch User" feature in their desktop environment, where the first user's desktop is still running in the background while another user is logged into their own desktop and using the screen (and physical keyboard). This is a very convenient feature even if you aren't actually sharing your computer with another person. There are many reasons why you might want to log into a different user's desktop to test something. Currently this absolutely requires `systemd` and `loginctl`.  

 1. A start on Wayland support. More on that further down.  

 1. The Option-key special characters, as described above. Two different layouts are available.  

 1. Automatic categorizing of the keyboard type of the current keyboard device. No more switching of keyboard types from the tray icon menu, or re-running the installer, or being asked to press a certain key on the keyboard during install. Some keyboard devices will need to be added to a Python list in the config to be recognized as the correct type. This will evolve over time from user feedback.  

 1. Changing of settings on-the-fly, without restarting the keymapper process. The tray icon menu and GUI preferences app will allow quickly enabling or disabling certain features, or changing the special characters layout. The change takes effect right away. (Adding or changing shortcuts in the config file will still require restarting the keymapper.)  

 1. Modmaps with `keyszer` are now concurrent/cascading rather than mutually exclusive. This enables some of the interesting fixes described in the following items.  

 1. Fix for "media" functions on arrow keys. Some laptop keyboards don't have the usual PgUp/PgDn/Home/End navigation functions on the arrow keys, when you hold the `Fn` key. Instead, they have PlayPause/Stop/Back/Forward. A `modmap` in the Toshy config will optionally fix this, making the arrow keys work more like a standard MacBook keyboard. This feature can be enabled from the tray icon or GUI preferences app.  

 1. This one is starting to become less relevant, with most common GTK apps already moving to GTK 4. But apps that use GTK 3 had a really annoying bug where they wouldn't recognize the "navigation" functions on the keypad keys (what the keypad keys do when NumLock is off) if you tried to use them with a modifier key (i.e., as part of a shortcut). Those keys would just get ignored. So if you didn't have the equivalent "real" navigation keys anywhere on your keyboard, there was no way to use shortcuts involving things like PgUp/PgDn/Home/End (on the numeric keypad). A `modmap` in the Toshy config will automatically fix this, if NumLock is off and the "Forced Numpad" feature (below) is disabled.  

 1. "Forced Numpad" feature: On PCs, if the keyboard has a numeric keypad, NumLock is typically off, so the keypad doesn't automatically act as a Numpad, instead providing navigation functions until you turn NumLock on. But if you've used macOS for any length of time, you might have noticed that the numeric keypad is always a numeric keypad, and the "Clear" key sends `Escape` to clear calculator apps. You have to use `Fn+Clear` to disable NumLock and get to the navigation functions. A `modmap` in the Toshy config is enabled by default and makes the numeric keypad always a numeric keypad, and turns the NumLock key into a "Clear" key. This can be disabled in the tray icon menu or GUI preferences app, or termporarily disabled with `Fn+Clear` (on Apple keyboards) or the equivalent of `Option+NumLock` on PC keyboards (usually this is physical `Win+NumLock`).  

 1. Sections of the config file are labeled with ASCII art designed to be readable on a "minimap" or "overview" sidebar view found in many text editors and code editors, to make finding certain parts of the config file a little easier. There's also a "tag" on each section that can be located easily with a `Find` search in any text editor.  

 1. Custom function to make the `Enter` key behave pretty much like it does in the Finder, in most Linux file managers. Mainly what this enables is using the `Enter` key to quickly rename files, while still leaving it usable in text fields like `Find` and the location bar. Not perfect, but works OK in most cases.  

 1. Evolving fix for the problem of `Cmd+W` unexpectedly failing to close a lot of Linux "child" windows and "dialog" windows (that have no binding to `Ctrl+W` and want either `Escape` or `Alt+F4/Ctrl+Q` to close). This can lead to a bad unconscious habit of hitting `Cmd+W` followed immediately by `Cmd+Q` (which becomes a problem when you're actually using macOS). The list of windows targeted by this pair of keymaps will grow over time, with input from users encountering the issue.  

 1. Fix for shortcut behavior in file save/open dialogs in apps like Firefox, now that WM_NAME is available. This is an addition to the "Finder Mods" that I contributed to Kinto, which are intended to mimic Finder keyboard behavior in most common Linux file manager apps.  

 1. A collection of tab navigation fixes for various apps with a tabbed UI that don't use the mostly standard Ctrl+PgUp/PgDn shortcuts. The goal is to allow `Shift+Cmd+Braces` (the left/right square bracket keys) to perform tab navigation in as many Linux applications (with tabbed UIs) as possible, as it does in most Mac applications with a tabbed UI (Finder, web browsers, and so on). Let me know if you use a Linux app where `Shift+Cmd+Braces` shortcuts are not working for tab navigation while Toshy is enabled. Use `xprop WM_CLASS _NET_WM_NAME` to obtain the window attributes for matching (if you use X11/Xorg).  

 1. Another growing collection of enhancements to various Linux apps to enable shortcuts like Cmd+comma (preferences) and Cmd+I (get info/properties) to work in more apps.  

 1. A function (`matchProps`) that enables very powerful and complex (or simple) matching on multiple properties at the same time. Application class, window name/title, device name, NumLock and CapsLock LED state can all be combined in any way, and lists can be made of specific combinations of one or more of those properties to match on.  

 1. More that I will add later when I remember...  

## Requirements

- Linux (no Windows support planned, use Kinto for Windows)

    - List of working/tested distros below

- `keyszer` (keymapper for Linux, forked from `xkeysnail`)

    - Automatically installed by Toshy installer

- X11 or Wayland+GNOME

    - Wayland+GNOME requires one of these GNOME Shell extensionsâ€¡ (see note):

        - Focused Window D-Bus
        - https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5592/focused-window-d-bus/

        - Window Calls Extended
        - https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4974/window-calls-extended/

        - Xremap (try this if you have an older GNOME version)
        - https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5060/xremap/

- Wayland+KDE (Plasma) should be possible at some point (in development)

- `systemd` (but you can just manually run the config from terminal, or shell script, or tray indicator menu)

- D-Bus, and `dbus-python` (for the tray indicator and GUI app)

â€¡ Note: It's very easy to search for and install GNOME Shell extensions now, if you install the "Extension Manager" Flatpak application from Flathub. No need to mess around with downloading a zip file from `extensions.gnome.org` and manually installing/enabling in the terminal. Many distros with GNOME need the `AppIndicator & KStatusNotifier` extension to make the tray icon appear in the top bar, and if you want to use Wayland you'll need one of the extensions from the list above.  

```sh
flatpak install com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager
```

... or:

```sh
flatpak install extensionmanager
```

You can just use the "Browse" tab in this application to search for the extensions by name and quickly install them.  

There will be no issue when installing both of the compatible extensions, which might be advisable to have less risk of not having a working extension for a while the next time you upgrade your system in-place and wind up with a newer version of GNOME. I expect at least one of the extensions will always be updated to support the latest GNOME. The branch of `keyszer` installed by Toshy will seamlessly jump to using the other extension in case one fails or is disabled for any reason.  

## How to Install

1. Download the latest zip from the big green `Code Ë‡` button near the top of the page.  
1. Unzip the archive, and open a terminal in the resulting folder.  
1. Run the `toshy_setup.py` script in the terminal.  

```sh
./toshy_setup.py
```

## Currently working desktop environments / window managers

- X11/Xorg (all desktops)
- Wayland+GNOME
- Wayland+KDE_Plasma (in development)

If you are in an X11/Xorg login session, the desktop environment or window manager doesn't really matter. The keymapper gets the window class/name/title information directly from the X server with `Xlib`.  

On the other hand, if you are in a Wayland session, it is only possible to obtain the per-application or per-window information (for specific shortcut keymaps) by using solutions that are custom to a limited set of desktop environments (or window managers).  

As of now, this means only the combination of Wayland+GNOME is fully usable for app-specific shortcut remapping, and this requires at least one of three known compatible GNOME Shell extensions to be installed. See above in "Requirements".  

At some point it should be possible to have Wayland+KDE_Plasma working, and possibly Wayland+sway and Wayland+hyprland. The methods to do this already exist in the `xremap` keymapper, but that project is written in Rust and `keyszer` is written in Python.  

There are specific remaps or overrrides of default remaps for several common desktop environments (or distros which have shortcut peculiarities in their default desktop setups). They become active if the desktop environment is detected correctly by the `env.py` module used by the config file, or the information about the desktop can be placed in some `OVERRIDE` variables in the config file.  

## Usage

Toshy does its best to set itself up automatically on any Linux system that uses `systemd` and that is a "known" Linux distro type that the installer knows how to deal with (i.e., has a list of the correct packages to install, and knows how to use the package manager). Generally this means distros that use `apt`, `dnf` or `pacman` so far.  

If the install was successful, there should be a number of different terminal commands available to check the status of the Toshy `systemd` user services (the services are not system-wide, in an attempt to support multi-user setups and be ready to support Wayland more easily) and stop/start/restart the services.  

Toshy actually consists of two separate `systemd` services meant to work together, with one monitoring the other, so the shell commands are meant to make working with the paired services much easier.  

These commands are copied into `~/.local/bin`, and you will be prompted to add that location to your shell's `PATH` if it is not present. Depends on the distro whether that location is already set up as part of the path or not.  

```
toshy-services-log      (shows journalctl output for Toshy services)
toshy-services-restart
toshy-services-start
toshy-services-status   (shows the current state of Toshy services)
toshy-services-stop

toshy-systemd-remove    (stops and removes the systemd service units)
toshy-systemd-setup     (installs and starts the systemd service units)
```

The following commands are also available, and meant to allow manually running just the Toshy config file, without any reliance on `systemd`. These will automatically stop the `systemd` services so there is no conflict, for instance if you need to run the `verbose` version of the command to debug a shortcut that is not working as expected, or find out how you broke the config file.  

Restarting the Toshy services, either with one of the above commands or from the GUI preferences app or tray icon menu, will stop the manual process and return to running the Toshy config as a `systemd` service. All the commands are designed to work together as conveniently as possible.  

```
toshy-config-restart
toshy-config-start
toshy-config-start-verbose  (show debugging output in the terminal)
toshy-config-stop
```

And a command that will show what Toshy sees as the environment when you launch the config. This may be helpful when troubleshooting or making reports:  

```
toshy-env
```

There are also some desktop "applications" that will be found in most Linux app launchers (like "Albert" or "Ulauncher") or application menus in Linux desktop environments:  

- Toshy Preferences
- Toshy Tray Icon

Both of these "apps" will show the current status of the `systemd` services, and allow the immediate changing of the exposed optional features, as well as stopping or restarting the Toshy services. The tray icon menu also allows opening the Preferences app, and opening the `~/.config/toshy` folder if you need to edit the config file.  

If the desktop apps aren't working for some reason, it may be useful to try to launch them from a terminal and see if they have any error output:  

```
toshy-gui
toshy-tray
```

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

This section will list some common questions, issues and fixes/tweaks that may be necessary for different distros, desktops or devices (and are not yet handled by the Toshy installer or config file). 

### What happened to my customizations of the config?!

Because the config file is continually evolving, and the config file itself is really a "program" written in Python that is literally executed as Python code by the keymapper (`keyszer`) at runtime, it's a bit difficult to retain the changes you've made and be sure that the new version of the config file will load without some sort of error.  

So the best solution I've come up with so far is to have the installer make a backup of your whole `~/.config/toshy` folder to a dated folder in `~/.config`. You'll find it/them in that "hidden" folder alongside the new `toshy` folder, and the backup will contain your previous `toshy_config.py` file.  

> PLEASE NOTE: If you run the Toshy installer multiple times you may find that the most recent dated "backup" is just a backup of a fresh Toshy config folder, as it will make a new backup whenever a `toshy` folder is found in `~/.config`. In this case, the folder with your custom changes may be in an older backup folder.  

The backup folders are typically less than 1 MB in size, as the Python virtual environment folder inside (20-30 MB) is not copied. So they should never take up too much space even if you run the installer multiple times on the same system.  

Using some software like Visual Studio Code, it is possible to compare the old and new config files in a "diff" sort of view and quickly see the differences. This can make it very easy to merge your custom changes back into the new config file with a few clicks. Then all you need to do is save the new config and restart the Toshy services or config script.  

If you keep your modifications within the `keyszer` API functions at the very beginning of the script, and the "User Apps" marked section around the middle of the config file, it should be pretty easy to merge your customizations back whenever you update Toshy or install on a new machine. The "User Apps" section is designed to be a good place in the config to put some customizations like making the brightness and volume keys on a laptop function row work correctly for your specific machine.  

I will be trying to work on doing a more automatic copying/merging of existing user settings into a new config file.  

There is an `include()` function in `keyszer` that theoretically allows separate files to be part of the config, but due to the dynamic nature of the config file, and how it gets loaded by the keymapper, I had a lot of issues trying to use that method to solve this problem.  

### My keyboard is not recognized as the correct type

If you run the verbose output script you'll be able to see the device name that `keyszer` is seeing when you use your keyboard. Run this in a terminal, and then use a remapped shortcut like `Shift+Cmd+Left_Brace` or `Shift+Cmd+Right_Brace` (the square bracket keys). Or just `Cmd+Tab` away from the terminal and back.  

```sh
toshy-config-start-verbose
```

Using the device name, you can look for the correct keyboard Python "list" in the config file and add the device name to the list. The list names are:   

```py
keyboards_IBM
keyboards_Chromebook
keyboards_Windows
keyboards_Apple
```

Add your device name as an item in the relevant list, and restart Toshy. The keyboard device should now be treated as the correct type, with the modifiers in the right places.  

> **_NOTE! If you have this problem, please submit an issue report about it, so the device name can be added to the default Toshy config!_**  

### CLI/Shell commands missing/unavailable

If you don't have `~/.local/bin` in your shell path, or you answered `n` when prompted during install to add it to the path, you will have to add it to the path yourself, or re-run the installer. Alternately, if you're trying to see the commands immediately after running the installer, you may need to run one of the following commands:  

```sh
hash -r
```

or...

```sh
source ~/.bashrc
```

or...

```sh
. ~/.bashrc
```

(The dot at the beginning is the equivalent of `source`.)  

Which RC file you need to `source` depends on your shell.  

In the case that the path was already added to the RC file, another way of getting a new environment where you can see the `toshy-*` commands is to just close your terminal window (or tab) and open a new one.  

### Touchpads/Trackpads and `keyszer` Suspend Timer

The `keyszer` (fork of `xkeysnail`) keymapper is pretty good, but there is an issue with [modifier key] + [tap or click] when using a touchpad versus a mouse. The keymapper uses a technique that "suspends" modifier key presses briefly (default is 1 second) to try and keep certain applications from seeing those modifier presses and performing some unwanted action. Notable apps that have issues with doing the wrong thing just from seeing a modifier key press are Visual Studio Code (and it's more Open Source variants VSCodium and Code - OSS) and the Firefox web browser. They will frequently focus or open items on the menu bar then they see the `Option/Alt` key in any way.  

The suspend timer scheme works well for mouse usage, letting you do things like `Alt+click`, `Ctrl+click/Cmd+click` and `Shift+click`, but with a touchpad, you may need to reduce the one-second timer to zero or 0.1 seconds in order for those operations to work as you would expect. Look for this near the top of the `toshy_config.py` file:  

```py
timeouts(
    multipurpose    = 1,        # default: 1 sec
    suspend         = 1,        # default: 1 sec, try 0.1 sec for touchpads
)
```

If you do need to disable or reduce the suspend timer because of the touchpad issue, it will become more important to implement the fixes below for VSCode and Firefox, to keep them from focusing the menu bar every time you hit `Option/Alt`.  

### VSCode(s) and Firefox menu stealing focus when hitting `Option/Alt`

For Firefox, the fix is relatively simple: Get to the advanced config settings by hitting `Cmd+comma` (if Toshy or Kinto is enabled), or by entering "about:config" into the URL/address bar. Accept the warning, and search for:  

```ini
ui.key.menuAccessKeyFocuses
```

Double-click the item to change it from "true" to "false", and the `Option/Alt` key will stop focusing the menu bar.  

For VSCode/VSCodium/Code-OSS, use `Cmd+Shift+P` to open the command palette, enter "open user settings json" to open the settings JSON file where you need to place these lines:  

```json
    "window.titleBarStyle": "custom",
    "window.enableMenuBarMnemonics": false,
    "window.customMenuBarAltFocus": false,
```

If there is nothing else in your user settings JSON file, it would need to have enclosing curly braces, like this:  

```json
{
    "window.titleBarStyle": "custom",
    "window.enableMenuBarMnemonics": false,
    "window.customMenuBarAltFocus": false
}
```

And the last line in every section of a JSON formatted file can't have a commma at the end, or there will be an error.  

You may be prompted to restart the app after saving this particular set of lines, and it will change how the VSCode window looks, with a combined menu/titlebar. The `Option/Alt` key will no longer focus the menu bar.  

### Option-key Special Character Entry (or Macros) Acting Weird

Sometimes, especially in virtual machines (but also on some bare metal installs) there is a problem in Linux with the "timing" of modifier key presses, leading to failures of some shortcut combos.  

The Option-key special characters in particular rely on a shortcut combo (`Shift+Ctrl+U`), and if that doesn't work the special character can't be created. And the mimicry of the highlighting of "dead keys" characters will probably also fail, since it does stuff like `Shift+Left`.  

This will also usually affect "macros" where you attempt to get the keymapper to type out multiple characters or strings or perform multiple shortcut combos when you use a shortcut. They may fail somewhere in the middle, or a shifted character will come out as a non-shifted character.  

A solution to this has been implemented in `keyszer`, and the API function is already in the Toshy config file. Injecting a short delay before and after the "normal" key press (to make sure that the modifier press and release are seen as happening with the correct timing) will usually solve the issue.  

Look for this code early in the Toshy config file:  

```py
throttle_delays(
    key_pre_delay_ms  = 0, # default: 0 ms, range: 0-150 ms, suggested: 1-50 ms
    key_post_delay_ms = 0, # default: 0 ms, range: 0-150 ms, suggested: 1-100 ms
)
```

For a bare metal install, a few milliseconds is usually sufficient to make infrequent glitches go away. Sometimes even as little as 1 ms, but often 2-4 ms for both delays is a good value to start with. For operating inside a virtual machine it may be necessary to use higher values like 50 ms (pre) and 70 ms (post) to get completely reliable behavior. With the right value the reliablity can be so close to 100% that it becomes impractical to find the failure in testing.  

Update for Wayland+GNOME:  

> I've decided to have values of 10/15 in the config by default, since even on bare metal installs there are often strange problems if there isn't a small delay. This is especially true on Wayland+GNOME, where the keymapper must rely on talking to a GNOME Shell extension to get the window info. I don't think this is quite as fast as using `Xlib` in X11/Xorg sessions, so many shortcuts are quite flaky without a bit of throttle delay.  

NB: A lengthy delay will of course cause macros to come out quite a bit more slowly as the delay gets longer. So really long macros will be potentially impractical inside a virtual machine, for instance. This is why the values are clamped to a maximum of 150 ms each. The keyboard will be unresponsive while a long macro is coming out. Currently there is no way to interrupt the macro in progress. Not a big deal when the delay is 1 ms per character, but a problem if the total delay between characters is 150 ms or more.  

### Macros Acting Weird/Failing/Unreliable

See above for the fix using `throttle_delays()`.  

### KDE Plasma and the Option-Key Special Characters

KDE Plasma desktops don't generally use `ibus` (like GNOME desktops usually do by default), or `fcitx` as an input manager. So you may find that the Option-key special character Unicode shortcut of `Shift+Ctrl+U` will not do anything, and the Unicode address of the special character will appear on screen instead of the desired character. This is unfortunately apparently not a shortcut that is built into the Linux kernel input system in general.  

The fix for this, if you want to use those characters in KDE apps, is to install `ibus` and use `im-chooser` to choose `ibus` as the input manager. You may also be able to use `fcitx` as I have seen some references to it supporting the `Shift+Ctrl+U` shortcut, but I haven't tested it.  

Otherwise, without a compatible input manager that responds to the `Shift+Ctrl+U` shortcut to enable Unicode character entry, the special characters will only work correctly in GTK-based applications, which seem to have the `ibus` response to that shortcut built into the GTK framework.  

### Sublime Text 3 and Option-Key Special Characters

For some reason, even when I am in GNOME, the Unicode character entry shortcut of `Shift+Ctrl+U` does not work in Sublime Text 3, so none of the Option-key special characters will work in that app. No idea why. Someone said that they couldn't replicate the problem in a build of Sublime Text 4, and that's all I know about it. No known workaround. (Other than moving to ST4.)  

### International/Non-US keyboard layouts

As of right now the keymapper has a key definition file (a mapping of key symbols to key codes) that is only designed for standard US/English keyboard layouts/languages. And, the keymapper has no knowledge of the current keyboard layout/language, which is remarkably difficult to obtain even on X11/Xorg, and Wayland is worse. Due to these limitations there will be shortcut combos that will act like you are using a US QWERTY keyboard layout, even though you are using, for instance, French AZERTY or something else. If you attempt to use `Cmd+A` on such a layout, the result will be `Cmd+Q` as the keymapper still thinks the `A` key is a `Q`. So instead of "Select All" you'd perform "Close Window".  

There is a solution to this, which is to find and modify the `key.py` file in the `keyszer` package folder (which in the case of Toshy will now be somewhere in `~/.config/toshy/.venv/`). But that would need to be done for every possible keyboard layout that is different from a US QWERTY layout.  

Some international users choose to use a US layout simply because it is a bit easier to use for coding, so they will not run into this problem.  

I'm still looking for a more general/flexible solution to this issue.  

Also, closely related, the Option-key special character schemes that have been implemented are based only on two US keyboard layouts in macOS, the standard US layout and the "ABC Extended" layout (which is still a US layout, but with enhancements to the available special characters and diacritic "dead keys"). So the special character arrangement will have differences from what an international user of macOS might be used to. This, also, is not going to be a simple problem to solve completely.  

### Meta vs Super vs Win(dows) vs Command/Cmd keys

These are all different names for the same key code. The Linux kernal appears to primarily refer to the key as `Meta`, while some Linux desktops (notably GNOME) like to refer to the same key as the `Super` key. Meanwhile, it is the same key as the `Windows` key on PC keyboards (which may have an image of "Tux" the Linux penguin on custom Linux keyboards/laptops). And, to top everything off, the Apple keyboard `Command` key uses the same key code.  

So, as far as the keymapper is concerned, using any of "Win", "Super", "Meta", or "Cmd" in the config file will result in the same key code. I will typically try to refer to it as "Meta" to match the Linux kernel documentation, but it depends on the circumstances. When referring to how it is used in GNOME I'll say "Super", for instance.  

### Xubuntu and the Meta/Super/Win/Cmd key

Xubuntu (using Xfce desktop environment) appears to run a background app at startup called `xcape` that binds the `Super/Meta/Win/Cmd` key (all different names for the same key) to activate the Whisker Menu by itself. To deactivate this, open the "Session and Startup" control panel app, go to the "Application Autostart" tab, and uncheck the "Bind Super Key" item. That will stop the `xcape` command from running at startup. Until you log out or restart, there will still be the background `xcape` process binding the key, but that can be stopped with:  

```sh
killall xcape
```

### Lubuntu Application Menu and Meta/Super/Win/Cmd key

In Lubuntu, right-click on the hummingbird(?) menu icon on the toolbar at the bottom of the screen, and select `Configure "Application Menu"` to change the keybinding from `Super_L` (left Meta key) to `Alt+F1`. If Toshy is enabled, using either the physical equivalent of `Cmd+Space` or `Option+F1` should work. if Toshy is disabled, just use the physical `Alt+F1` keys. NB: The shortcut apparently needs to be set very quickly after clicking the button to change the shortcut. If it doesn't work the first time, just try again, until it says `Alt+F1`.  

### Linux Mint Application Menu (Cinnamon/Xfce/MATE) and the Meta/Super/Win/Cmd key

On Linux Mint (Cinnamon and MATE variants) they use a custom menu widget/applet that is set up to activate with the Meta/Super/Win/Cmd key. The shortcut for this is not exposed in the usual keyboard shortcuts control panels. Right-click on the menu applet icon and go to "Configure" or "Preferences" (make sure you're not opening the preferences for the entire panel, just the menu applet).  

You will see a couple of things that vaguely look like buttons. You can click on the first one and set the shortcut to something like `Ctrl+Esc`. Click on the other button and hit `Backspace` and it will show "unassigned". This will disable the activation of the menu with the Meta/Super/Win/Cmd key.  

Alternately, instead of disabling the secondary shortcut, you could set the secondary shortcut to `Alt+Space` (use the keys corresponding to the physical position of `Option+Space` on an Apple keyboard if Toshy is enabled), but you will have to track down the same shortcut in the regular keyboard shortcuts control panel (something like "Window menu"?) and disable it. If you do this, it will be possible to open the application menu with the same physical keys whether Toshy is enabled or disabled.  

You may need to temporarily DISABLE Toshy (from the tray icon menu, or the GUI preferences app) if it is active, in order to successfully set the main shortcut to `Ctrl+Esc`. Then re-enable Toshy. Or, press the equivalent on your keyboard of `Cmd+Space` when setting the shortcut, and what should appear as the new shortcut is `Ctrl+Esc`.  

If Cinnamon is detected by the Toshy config, `Cmd+Space` will already be getting remapped onto `Ctrl+Esc`, so you should now be able to open the application menu with `Cmd+Space`, if you assigned the suggested shortcut to it.  

In MATE, the remap is set to `Alt+Space`, which is a shortcut that doesn't seem to intefere with any existing shortcut. To set this as the shortcut for the menu applet in MATE, Toshy must be disabled while setting the shortcut, then re-enabled afterward.  

In the Xfce variant of Mint, they use the Whisker Menu applet, and the shortcut (Super_L) is exposed in **_Keyboard >> Application Shortcuts_**. The Toshy config remap for Xfce is set to `Super+Space`, to avoid conflicts with other Xfce functions. So if you set the shortcut for the Whisker Menu to `Super+Space`, it should start working when you use `Cmd+Space`. It shouldn't be necessary to disable Toshy, but the physical keys to set the shortcut to `Super+Space` with Toshy enabled will be physical `Ctrl+Space`.  

### GNOME and the Meta/Super/Win/Cmd key (`overlay-key`)

By default GNOME desktops seem to want to use the Meta/Super/Win/Cmd key to open the "overview". This is not a shortcut that is exposed in the usual `Settings >> Keyboard` control panel. The Toshy installer will disable the binding if GNOME is detected, since it's weird/unexpected in macOS for a modifier key to perform an action by itself.  

Here are the commands to disable and re-enable the `overlay-key` binding:  

Disable:  

```sh
gsettings set org.gnome.mutter overlay-key ''
```

Enable/Re-enable:  

```sh
gsettings reset org.gnome.mutter overlay-key
```

### GNOME "Switch Windows" vs "Switch Applications" (Cmd+Tab task switching)

GNOME desktops have the ability to either do task switching like Windows (switch between all open windows individually) or like macOS (switch between "applications" as groups of windows). Except where an extension is interfering with this ability, like the COSMIC desktop extension on Pop!_OS. Depending on the Linux distro, `Alt+Tab` may be assigned to "Switch windows" or to "Switch applications".  

If you want to task switch more like macOS, set the "Switch applications" shortcut in the GNOME Keyboard settings control panel to be the one assigned `Alt+Tab`, and set the "Switch windows of an application" to be `Alt+Grave` (the "`" backtick/Grave character, above the Tab key).  

Note that this will also change the appearance and function of the task switcher dialog that appears when you use the corresponding shortcut. The "Switch applications" shortcut is like the macOS task switcher, it shows one large application icon for each group of windows belonging to the same "application". The "Switch windows" shortcut will show a task switcher that has a preview icon for every **_window_** open on the current workspace, similar to Windows and Linux desktop environments like KDE Plasma. The "large icons" task switcher tends to have far fewer items and be easier to navigate visually. Just like on macOS, the equivalent of `Cmd+Grave` can be used to switch windows of the same application.  

Which task switching style works for you is down to personal preference, and how well you like the macOS style of task switching with `Cmd+Tab`.  

### KDE Plasma and the Meta/Super/Win/Cmd key

KDE Plasma desktops tend to have the Meta/Super/Win/Cmd key bound to open the application menu. Like the other desktop environments that bind the `Meta` key to do something by itself, this appears to be an alien concept as far as the regular keyboard shortcut control panel is concerned. You won't find it there. To disable this secret modifier-only binding, you have to put something in a hidden dotfile and refresh `KWin`.  

Open the file `~/.config/kwinrc`, or create it if it doesn't exist. Append this information at the end of the file: 

```ini
[ModifierOnlyShortcuts]
Meta=
```

Then, run this command in the terminal: 

```sh
qdbus org.kde.KWin /KWin reconfigure
```

To undo this, remove or comment out the same text in the file, and run the same command. The `Meta` key binding should be back.  

### More Will Follow...

I'll add to this as more testing happens and more reports come in.
